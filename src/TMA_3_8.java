/*
(15%) Let G be a graph whose vertices are the integers 1 through 8, and let the adjacent vertices of each vertex be given by the table below.
Assume that, in a traversal of G, the adjacent vertices of a given vertex are returned in the same order as they are listed in the table above. You need to:
Draw graph G. (5%)
Give the sequence of the vertices of G visited using the depth-first search traversal starting at vertex 1. (5%)
Give the sequence of vertices visited using the breadth-first search traversal starting at vertex 1. (5%)
