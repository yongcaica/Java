/*
(10%) Suppose we are given an n-element sequence, S, such that each element in S represents a different vote for president, where each vote is given as an integer representing a particular candidate. Design an O(nlogn)-time algorithm to see who wins the election S represents, assuming the candidate with the most votes wins (even if there are O(n) candidates).
